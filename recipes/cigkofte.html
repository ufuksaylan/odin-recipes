    <li>5 large ripe tomatoes </li>            
    <li>2 cups fine bulgur</li>
    <li>2 medium onions</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic</li>
    <li>2 slices stale bread</li>
    <li>1 cup walnut halves</li>
    <li>1/2 cup olive oil</li>
    <li>1/2 cup pomegranate concentrate</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Turkish isot biber</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon red pepper paste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>hopped fresh parsley, for garnish</li>
    <li>chopped green onion, for garnish</li>
    <li>Romain lettuce leaves, for serving</li>
    <li>Lemon wedges, for serving</li>


    </ul>
    <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the tomatoes and peel them using a small, sharp knife. Place the peeled tomatoes in a food processor and puree them, or finely grate them using a hand grater. </li>
        <li>Rinse the bulgur under cold water in a wire strainer for a few minutes. Drain it and put it in a large mixing bowl along with the tomato puree. Mix together well, cover the bowl, and set it aside for about 1 hour until the bulgur is softened. </li>
        <li> Peel and coarsely chop the onions and garlic and put them in the food processor along with the stale bread and the walnut halves. Pulverize on high speed until you have a fine powder. </li>
        <li>Add this mixture to the tomato and bulgur along with the rest of the ingredients. Wearing rubber gloves, knead the mixture until all the ingredients are well combined. </li>
        <li> Divide the mixture into portions small enough to fit inside the food processor. Process each portion on medium speed until smooth. Combine all the processed portions together in a large bowl and continue to knead until it has a smooth consistency.</li>
        <li>Place in a bowl and cover with an airtight seal; set aside for at least 5 hours or overnight. </li>
        <li> The next morning, break off bite-sized pieces of the mixture and shape them into fingerprint shapes. Arrange them on a serving plate with leaves of Romaine lettuce and slivers of fresh lemon for squeezing. </li>
